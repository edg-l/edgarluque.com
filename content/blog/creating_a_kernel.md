This is some kind of blog series about my journey as I learn and implement my own Rust kernel.

Any knowledge shared here may not be fully true, since i do this as a hobby and I'm not an experienced kernel developer.
I'm just doing this for fun, learning about the true low level bits that make up a computer with the x86_64 architecture.
